### Hey! How you doing? :sun_with_face:

My name's Issy, I'm a Software Developer with a TV background.

- I'm currently training :muscle: with [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/).
- You can have a peek at what I'm learning :bulb: about [here](https://github.com/isobelbutler/fac-portfolio).
- Feel free to contact me :speech_balloon: at **isobutler@icloud.com** or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isobelbutler/).<br>

#### What are my strengths? 

- Finding <strong>patterns</strong>, creative <strong>problem-solving</strong>, and <strong>logical</strong> thinking :microscope:
- <strong>Design</strong>. I was the Asst. Art Director on MasterChef :clapper: and worked in the TV Art Department for 5 years
- <strong>People</strong>. Getting along with a variety of personalities was central to my TV career. Being able to communicate clearly and have a laugh despite tight deadlines, high pressure, and 16 hour days is one of the learnings I'm most grateful for.
- <strong>Language</strong>. I studied English Language and Literature :green_book: at the University of Leeds :mortar_board: and love finding patterns and analysing their implications.

#### A little more about me...

- I love all things making and fixing :wrench:
- Green spaces make me happy - I've worked as a farm labourer :ear_of_rice:, a gardener, and in a plant shop.<br>
- I'm a keen cyclist :bike:, this year I want to cycle the C2C, a multi-day ride across the width of the UK from the Irish Sea to the North Sea.<br>
