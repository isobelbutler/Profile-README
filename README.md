### Hey, I'm Issy!

I'm a Software Engineer at Greenworkx, feel free to drop me a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isobelbutler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>

#### A little more about me...

- I love all things making and fixing :wrench:
- I'm a keen cyclist :bike:, this year I want to cycle the C2C, a multi-day ride across the width of the UK from the Irish Sea to the North Sea.<br>
